## Pop Img

A simple jQuery plugin for poping imgs in articles without any additional css or image.

There are no settings in this plugin, so that making it much simpler, just 80 lines code.

### Usage

```javascript
$(".container img").popImg();
```

The effect is poping a half opacity layer fixed full of webpage, then show the target image in it's original size.

Click any area will close the img show. And you can press the `ESC` key to clear screen.

> Attention: I set a very large `z-index` for layer and img.
