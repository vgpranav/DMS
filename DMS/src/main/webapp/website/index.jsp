With the primary purpose of simplifying your life, our software handles all the strenuous paperwork for you whether you have a large society or a commercial building.  

We understand how difficult it can be to handle accounting and other documentation processes in a society, especially when there is a new person handling it every year. But all that will never be a worry with Our Digital Society software.

Our programs will assist you with uploading documents online and accessing them with a simple keyword research, whenever required. The program makes it convenient for the management to record smallest of the details online, eliminating the usage of papers completely.

								<ul>
									<li class="" data-wow-offset="0" data-wow-delay="0.3s">&bull; Housing Society Document Management System (HS-DMS)</li>
									<li class="" data-wow-offset="0" data-wow-delay="0.5s">&bull; Housing Society Invoice, Payment and Report System (HS-IPR)</li>
									<li class="" data-wow-offset="0" data-wow-delay="0.7s">&bull; Commercial Society Document Management System (HS-DMS)</li>
									<li class="" data-wow-offset="0" data-wow-delay="0.9s">&bull; Commercial Society Invoice, Payment and Report System (HS-IPR)</li>
								</ul>
							 <br/><br/>The programs developed by Our Digital Society were inspired by the Digital India vision initiated by the Government of India. To support the e-governance plan of the Prime Minister our company decided to create these transparent online documentation programs. 
							 <br/><br/>These tools make sure that every citizen can experience public accountability which is the primary motive of Digital India vision. Other than this, using our software can also help increase digital literacy around the country and reducing the budget of paper documentation which is another futuristic vision of Digital India.
